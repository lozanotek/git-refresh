# Git Refresh Workshop - Partner Activity

This is a pretty simple activity for you to complete with a partner. Please do the following:

* Add alias **lol** to your shell.
* **Step 1**
    * Fork repository from [lozanotek/github-games](https://lzno.tk/github-games).
    * Add your partner as a collaborator to your fork of the repository.
    * Clone your partner's repository to your local machine.
    * Use clone repo and give a different name
        * git clone URL repo-name
    * Create a branch called partner-instructions in your partner's repo.
    * Add instructions for playing the game (beginning at line 7) to the README.md
    * Push your branch to your partner's repo and open a pull request.
* **Step 2**
    * After your partner has completed step 1:
    * Go back to your copy of the game and merge the game-instructions branch in your own repo (you can use a pull request or do it locally).
    * Go to the pull request your partner created and resolve any merge conflicts in your own repo.
* **Extra Credit**
    * If you can get the game working, go for it.

That's it! We'll review as a group.
